    title: 'What are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)?',
    text: 'NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token, which can be broken down into “Non-Fungible” and “Token.” “Non-fungible” notes that the crypto assets unique identification codes and metadata cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. This juxtaposes fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies (e.g., bitcoin), which are identical to each other and, therefore, can be used as a medium for commercial transactions."Tokeninzing" these real-world tangible assets allows them to be bought, sold, and traded more efficiently while reducing the probability of fraud.',
    subText:
      'These unique files live on the blockchain where they denote ownership. NFTs can be anything digital such as music, images, or video, but most of the excitement lately has been around art.Some may equate fine art collecting with the current landscape of NFTs: If you can collect well-known artworks in real life, why not in the digital realm?',
