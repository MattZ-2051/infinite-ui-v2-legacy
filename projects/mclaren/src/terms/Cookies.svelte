    To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device. A cookie is a
    small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the
    website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, shopping cart, or other preferences) over a period
    of time, so you do not have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to
    another.

    The following table sets out the different categories of cookies that our site uses, and why we use them. The lists
