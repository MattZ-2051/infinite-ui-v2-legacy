  following lawful grounds:
</p>
<ul class="bullet-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Consent. </strong>
    Where appropriate or legally required, we collect and use your information subject to your consent. When information

  <li>
    <strong>Performance of contract. </strong>
    We collect and use information about you to enter into a contract with you or to perform a contract that you have with

    <strong>Legitimate interests.</strong>
    We collect and use information about you for our legitimate interests, for example to deliver the products and services

  <li>
    <strong>Compliance with laws.</strong>
    We may also collect and use information about you: (i) as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar
    legal process, (ii) when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or property, protect
    your health and safety or the health and safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, or
    (iii) if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets.

<p>
  We may use personal information about you in automated decision making or profiling to the extent consistent with the
  permitted uses described in this privacy notice.

  We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized
  access, use, alteration, and disclosure. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we
  have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Platform you are responsible
  for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

</p>
<h2 id="data-retention"><a href="#{lowerCaseShortName}-quick-links">13. Data Retention</a></h2>
<p>
  We may retain your personal information for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection (see
  the <a href="#how-we-use-{lowerCaseShortName}" class="italic">"How We Use Your Information"</a> section above) or as long
  as required to fulfill our legal obligations. We determine the appropriate retention period for personal information on
  the basis of the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information being processed, the potential risk of harm
  from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information, whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing
  through other means, and on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).
</p>
<p>
  After expiry of the applicable retention periods, your personal information will be deleted. If there is any data that
  we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will implement appropriate measures to
