      <strong>Acknowledgment And Assumption Of Risks</strong>
    </h2>
  </div>
  <p class="mb-3">
    Use of the ARIA Exchange may carry financial and legal risk. NFTs, such as NFTs, are a novel and relatively
    experimental technology. Their value, if any, can fluctuate with great volatility, and transactions conducted with
    NFTs are irreversible. NFTs and smart contracts are typically described using extremely technical language that is
    difficult to understand and requires a deep knowledge of cryptography and computer science. Functionality made
    available on the ARIA Exchange may have inherent design flaws that have not been detected in testing or may not
    perform as expected in conjunction with third-party technology or high-volume use. You should carefully consider
    whether you have sufficient understanding of the technology and the applicable law before accessing or using the
    ARIA Exchange. Hedera uses gossip, virtual voting and hashgraph mechanisms to measure consensus. These technologies
    and platforms may have unique benefits, limitations, advantages and disadvantages. It is up to you to understand
    these factors.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    <span class="mr-2">a.</span>
    By accessing or using the ARIA Exchange, you hereby represent that you have the requisite knowledge and experience to
    evaluate the risk of the technology you are using and any transactions you undertake, and you accept the risk that the
    ARIA Exchange might not function as anticipated and that you might lose access to your NFTs and/or the ARIA Exchange
    temporarily or permanently. Without limitation of the foregoing, you also acknowledge and accept the following risks:
    The prices of collectible blockchain assets such as NFTs are extremely volatile and subjective and collectible blockchain
    assets have no inherent or intrinsic value. Fluctuations in the price of other NFTs could materially and adversely affect
    the value of your NFTs, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. Each NFT has no inherent or intrinsic
    value. ARIA cannot guarantee that any NFTs purchased will retain their original value, as the value of collectibles is
    inherently subjective and factors occurring outside of the ARIA Exchange may materially impact the value and desirability
    of any particular NFT.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    <span class="mr-2">b.</span>
    It may be extremely difficult to sell or transfer your NFT, other than via the ARIA Exchange, due to the nature of the
    NFT and its existence on the Blockchain Technology.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    <span class="mr-2">c.</span>
    You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your NFT-related transactions. We are not responsible
    for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the ARIA Exchange.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    <span class="mr-2">d.</span>
    There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, legal risks, the risk
    of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third
    parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your electronic Wallet. You accept and acknowledge
    that the ARIA Parties will not be responsible for legal risks, any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions
    or delays you may experience when using the Blockchain Technology, however caused.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    <span class="mr-2">e.</span>
    The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations
    or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the ARIA Exchange ecosystem, and therefore the potential
    utility or value of your NFTs.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    <span class="mr-2">f.</span>
    Upgrades to the Blockchain Technology, a hard fork in the Blockchain Technology, or a change in how transactions are
    confirmed on the Blockchain Technology may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the Blockchain Technology,
    including the ARIA Exchange.

      <strong>Additional Terms And Conditions</strong>

  </div>
  <p class="mb-3">
    Additional terms and conditions (<strong>“Additional Terms”</strong>) may apply to specific portions, services or
    features of the ARIA Exchange provided by ARIA or third-parties, including, but not limited to, Consumer Experiences
    and Limited Editions.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    <span class="mr-2">a.</span>
    <strong>“Consumer Experiences”</strong> means consumer offers, contests or sweepstakes, auctions for collectibles and
    memorabilia, and other similar or related consumer experiences made available through the ARIA Exchange, either alone
    or in conjunction with the NFTs or other functionality provided by us. The use of such services or features shall be
    governed by the Additional Terms associated with them, and all such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated by this
    reference into these ARIA Supplemental TOS. The ARIA Parties accept no liability or responsibility for any third-party
    functionality or any of our open- source functionality that has been modified by third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to any other Additional Terms that may be associated with the Consumer Experiences, You agree that your
    participation in a Consumer Experience is for non-revenue generating, personal use only. You agree that to the
    extent any photography or videography is allowed during a Consumer Experience that it will be (1) for personal use
    only and for no commercial purpose, (2) in good taste, (3) free of any association with drugs, alcohol, or criminal
    or illegal conduct, (4) depict no obscene or immoral act, and (5) shall not demean, disparage, or make ARIA Parties
    or any other third party included in the Consumer Experience the subject of public disrepute, contempt, or scandal.
    All rights of publicity, privacy, intellectual property, and any other legal or moral rights related to the Consumer
    Experience are solely owned by and all interests vest in the ARIA Parties or the relevant third party, as specified
    in the Additional Terms.  Unless otherwise indicated in the Additional Terms, participation in a Consumer Experience
    is transferable only with the resale of the NFT and only if the NFT is resold in a secondary sale on the ARIA
    Exchange.  Any other subsequent transfer or resale of the NFT will make the Consumer Experience null and void.  If
    participation in a Consumer Experience involves a third party, this Consumer Experience will be scheduled at a
    mutually agreeable time within 365 days of the date of award of the Consumer Experience (the “Consumer Experience
    Term”). If the third party becomes unavailable to appear at the mutually agreed upon time for the Consumer
    Experience for reasons beyond the third party’s control, the length of the Consumer Experience Term will be extended
    by ten (10) days (or such other period specified in the Additional Terms) to allow for rescheduling.  In addition to
    the limitations and disclaimers set forth in these ARIA Supplemental TOS and any Additional Terms, ARIA Parties and
    any third party participating in the Consumer Experience are not responsible for any delays, interruptions, or
    impairment to the Consumer Experience that may be caused by technical failures of any kind, the unavailability or
    inaccessibility of any transmissions or Internet service, or any unauthorized human intervention. If and to the
    extent that any third parties  are involved in the Customer Experience (e.g. celebrities, property owners of a
    destination location, designers or manufacturers of any physical item, etc.), none of the ARIA Parties shall have
    any responsibility or liability for the acts or omissions of any such third parties and as between any User and the
    ARIA Parties, such third parties shall be the beneficiaries of any and all waivers and limits of liability set forth
    herein in favor of the ARIA Parties as if each such third party is included in the definition of ARIA Parties.

  <p class="mb-3">
    <span class="mr-2">b.</span>
    <strong>“Limited Editions”</strong>means NFTs that are released or “dropped” with a commitment that only a limited
    number of unique NFTs will be associated with the same Content or associated utility or add-on Customer Experiences.
    Any such commitments as to limited numbers, editions or versions will be solely as expressly set forth in the
    Additional Terms specified in connection with such NFTs (“Limited Edition Terms”). For clarity, notwithstanding
    anything to the contrary in any Limited Edition Additional Terms, in no event does VRM represent, warrant or
    guarantee that others have not created or downloaded their own copies of the Content associated with such Limited
    Editions (including via unauthorized ripping or downloading of such Content), or that others will not attempt to
    sell their own NFTs featuring such Content or similar Content. Company has no obligation or liability to take down
    such other NFTs featuring such Content or to take any other action to prevent third parties from such activities.
    Further, the foregoing does not restrict the Company from selling other Content associated with the same event,
    individual or property as featured in any Limited Edition, as long as such other Content or associated utility or
    Customer Experience are different from the Content or associated utility or Customer Experience associated with the
    Limited Edition (e.g., different image, art, camera angle, background music, privileges, etc.). Even minor
    differences shall qualify as differences for these purposes.

    <strong>Signed NFTs/Content.</strong>Certain NFTs may be associated with Content that includes a signature or other
    personalization as part of the Third Party IP included in such Content (a “Signed NFT”). In addition, certain
    physical items provided as part of Customer Experiences may be signed either originally or digitally (“Signed
    Physical Items” and together with Signed NFTs, the “Signed Items”). In connection with any sale by VRM as Seller to
    any Buyer, VRM represents and warrants to the Buyer of any Signed Item that the Signed Item purchased by such Buyer
    are authentic and genuine signatures from the individual purporting to sign, which signature is input and rendered
    digitally in the case of Signed NFTs and digitally signed Signed Physical Items. VRM’s basis for this representation
    will include reasonable steps taken by VRM to such signature is authentic (i.e. was created by the person purporting
    to sign), which steps may include, without limitation (i) having a written license agreement pursuant to which the
    individual signing agrees to provide his/her signature and licenses the use of that signature to VRM; (ii) VRM
    collects the signature from the individual signing (or their representatives) in a trackable or documented manner
    such that VRM (or its applicable personnel) reasonably believes that the person who created the signature is the
    person they are purporting to be and the signature to be genuine or (iii) VRM obtains a representation given to VRM
    from the individual signing, made at the time of signature, that the individual is the person they are purporting to
    be, and that the signature input is their genuine signature. The Company’s basis for the representation may also
    include any other reasonable additional evidence of authenticity. Any attempts of VRM to comply in whole or in part
    with California Code, Civil Code § 1739.7 (or any other similar state or federal laws) shall not be deemed an
    admission that any such law or regulation applies to the sale of Signed Items and VRM hereby disclaims any such
    admission.

  <p>
    The terms and conditions set forth in this ARIA NFT License Terms shall automatically apply to all Transfers
    (defined below) of NFTs on the ARIA Exchange. By entering into any Transfer transaction on the ARIA Exchange each of
    the applicable Seller(s) and Buyer(s) party to that transaction automatically agree to these Terms.
  </p>
  <p class="font-bold">1. Definitions</p>
  <p>
    “Art” means any art, design, audio, video, media of any kind, AR/VR/XR, drawings, text, or other content or
    materials of any kind or nature that are associated, through hash, link, or otherwise, with an NFT. “Buyer” means
    the party who is (or is intended to be) the Owner of an NFT after a Transfer transaction on the ARIA Exchange. ”NFT”
    means a non-fungible token on the Hedera hashgraph or other blockchain. “Own” means, with respect to an NFT, an NFT
    that the party purporting to own such NFT has purchased or otherwise rightfully acquired from a legitimate source,
    where proof of such purchase or Transfer is recorded on the relevant blockchain or its equivalent. “Purchased NFT”
    means an NFT that is Owned by a party as a result of a Transfer transaction on the ARIA Exchange. “Seller” means the
    party who Owns and listed for sale an NFT prior to a Transfer transaction on the ARIA Exchange. “Third Party IP”
    means any third-party patent rights (including, without limitation, patent applications and disclosures),
    copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, use of likeness, know-how or any other intellectual property rights
    recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the world. “Transfer” means, with respect to an NFT and the license
    rights under the Art associated with such NFT or any element of the foregoing, any voluntary or involuntary sale,

    purported transfer to or from a trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, or assignee for the benefit of creditors. “User”
    means any Buyer or Seller.`
  </p>
  <p class="font-bold">2. Ownership of Art</p>
  <p>
    VRM is the owner or licensee of all Art associated with all NFTs available for purchase and sale in the ARIA
    Exchange. As such, VRM reserves all rights in and to the Art associated with each NFT purchased and sold in the ARIA
    Exchange that is not expressly granted to the buyer of such NFT under this License.
  </p>
  <p class="font-bold">3. License to Art</p>
  <p>
    a. General Use. Subject to the Buyer’s continued compliance with the terms of this License, VRM hereby grants to the
    buyer of any NFT purchased and sold on the ARIA Exchange (the “Buyer”) a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
    royalty- free license to use, copy, and display the Art associated with such NFT solely for the following purposes:
    (i) for Buyer’s own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of any platform that permits the purchase and sale of
    such NFT, provided that the platform cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art
    associated with the NFTs they Own to ensure that only the actual owner can display the associated Art; or (iii) as
    part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your NFTs,
    provided, for both clauses (ii) and (iii) that the platform/website/application cryptographically verifies each NFT
    owner’s rights to display the Art associated with NFTs they Own to ensure that only the actual owner can display the
    associated Art, and provided that the Art associated with an NFT is no longer visible once the owner of such NFT
    leaves the platform/website/application. b. Commercial Use. Buyer has no license or rights to make commercial use of
    the Art associated with the NFT. c. Changes by VRM After Sale. After an NFT is purchased in a Transfer transaction
    via the ARIA Exchange, VRM may, but shall have no obligation to, add additional Art associated with the NFT and/or
    modify the Art associated with the NFT to, among other things, improve the NFT to facilitate subsequent sales of the
    NFT. Any person buying an NFT on the ARIA Exchange expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Art associated with
    the NFT is subject to such future modification.
  </p>
  <p class="font-bold">4. General Restrictions on Use of Licensed Art</p>
  <p>
    Buyer may not, any may not permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the following: (a) copy or modify
    the Art associated with Buyer’s Purchased NFT in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs,
    drawings, attributes, or color schemes (except to the extent Buyer is permitted to make modifications using
    functionality included within the applicable NFT); (b) use the Art associated with Buyer’s Purchased NFTs to
    advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service; (c) use the Art associated with Buyer’s Purchased
    NFTs in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty,
    or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of
    others; (d) use the Art associated with Buyer’s Purchased NFTs in movies, videos, or any other forms of media,
    except to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in Section 3(b) above or solely for your own
    personal, non-commercial use; (e) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away
    in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise (whether virtual or tangible) that
    includes, contains, or consists of the Art associated with Buyer’s Purchased NFTs (either in whole or any part); (f)
    attempt to trademark, copyright, create derivative works, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property
    rights in or to the Art associated with Buyer’s Purchased NFTs; (g) otherwise utilize the Art associated with
    Buyer’s Purchased NFTs for Buyer’s or any third party’s commercial benefit; or (h) to represent or imply any sort of
    sponsorship, endorsement, affiliation, or other relationship with the seller and/or the creator of the Art without
    the prior authorization of such seller, creator or other party(ies) that hold(s) such rights. The restriction in
    this Section will survive the expiration or termination of this License.
  </p>
  <p class="font-bold">5. Additional Restrictions - Third Party IP included in Licensed Art</p>
  <p>
    To the extent that Art associated with Buyer’s Purchased NFTs contains Third Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual
    property from a celebrity, athlete, or other public figure), you understand and agree as follows: (a) that you will
    not have the right to use such Third-Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the
    license and restrictions contained herein (b) that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the owner of
    the Third Party IP, VRM may need to (and reserves every right to) pass through additional restrictions on your
    ability to use the Art; and (c) to the extent that VRM informs you of such additional restrictions in writing, you
    will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that
    failure to do so will be deemed a breach of the License. The restriction in this Section will survive the expiration
    or termination of this License.
  </p>
  <p class="font-bold">6. Duration of License to Art</p>
  <p>
    The License granted in Section 3 to the Buyer applies only during such time period that Buyer continues to Own the
    applicable Purchased NFT. If at any time Buyer sells, trades, donates, gives away, transfers, or otherwise disposes
    of Buyer’s Purchased NFT for any reason, the License granted in Section 3 will immediately expire with respect the
    Art associated with such NFT without the requirement of notice, and Buyer will have no further rights in or to the
    Art associated with such NFT.
  </p>
  <p class="font-bold">7. Terms of Sale of NFT</p>
  <p>
    Ownership of an NFT (but not the associated Art) purchased in the ARIA Exchange will not pass to the Buyer until the
    Seller has received full, clear and undisputed payment of all amounts due, even in circumstances where possession or
    control of the NFT may have already transferred to the Buyer. All risk in and responsibility for an NFT will
    transfer to the Buyer once the Seller takes all actions necessary to transfer such NFT to the digital wallet that
    Buyer specified for receipt of such NFT, which time may be determined at VRM’s discretion, including through
    observation of the transfer on the blockchain on which the NFT is stored. It is the responsibility of Buyer to
    conduct adequate due diligence on the NFT Buyer is purchasing. (including any smart contract for minting the NFT or
    otherwise applicable to such NFT) to confirm the NFT (or applicable smart contract) executes as it is intended to
    execute. Buyer further understand that blockchain transactions are usually not reversible. Buyer understands that
    NFTs and other NFTs may only exist by virtue of the ownership record maintained on a blockchain, and are conducted
    and occur on decentralized ledgers. ARIA has no control over and makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the
    functioning of such blockchain or the persistence or compatibility, or lack thereof, of the NFT or related Art.
  </p>
  <p class="font-bold">8. Taxes/Exchange Fees</p>
  <p>
    Buyer will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments
    (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (“Taxes”)
    associated the purchase of any NFT. Except for income taxes levied on us, Buyer: (a) will pay or reimburse us for
    all such Taxes; and (b) will not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such Taxes from payments due to Seller or
    any other party in connection with the purchase and sale of the NFT.
  </p>
  <p class="font-bold">9. Subsequent Transfers of NFTs and Art</p>
  <p>
    Any subsequent Transfer of a Purchased NFT and the Art associated with such NFT is prohibited and null and void
    unless all of the following requirements are satisfied: (a) the Transfer is conducted on or through the ARIA
    Exchange or another platform sanctioned by VRM and such Transfer must include the NFT and all licensed rights in the
    Art associated with the NFT; (b) the subsequent Buyer agrees to, becomes legally bound by, and takes the Art
    associated with such NFT subject to, this License Agreement and evidence of the same is provided in writing through
    the applicable platform to VRM immediately upon transfer and (c) VRM receives a payment from the Seller in such
    Transfer equal to the ARIA Creator Surcharge Percentage (as defined below) of the gross sale price. These
    requirements and the License shall apply in perpetuity to all successive Transfers of any NFT (and associated Art)
    initially purchased and sold in the ARIA Exchange. Each Buyer of an NFT in the ARIA Exchange acknowledges and agrees
    that the “first sale doctrine” does not apply to such NFT and/or the Art associated with the NFT (and/or the
    intellectual property rights in, under and to such Art). The “ARIA Creator Surcharge Percentage” is a percentage of
    the gross sale price that must be paid to ARIA upon any subsequent sale of an NFT originally sold by ARIA on the
    ARIA Exchange, where the applicable percentage will be specified in writing to Buyer at the time of sale and/or
    included in the smart contract associated with the applicable NFT. The applicable ARIA Creator Surcharge Percentage
    is incorporated by reference into this license and must be disclosed by Buyer to any subsequent recipient in any
    subsequent Transfer of the NFT.
  </p>
  <p class="font-bold">10. LEGAL NOTICES</p>
  <p>
    THE ART ASSOCIATED WITH NFTS AVAILABLE FOR SALE IN THE ARIA EXCHANGE IS STORED “OFF CHAIN”. THIS MEANS THAT THE ART
    IS NOT INCLUDED AS PART OF THE COMPUTER CODE THAT CONSTITUTES THE NFT. INSTEAD, THE CODE OF EACH NFT REFERS TO AN
    ONLINE WEB ADDRESS WHERE THE ART IS STORED. NEITHER VRM NOR ANY OTHER ENTITY IS RESPONSIBLE IF AN NFT OR THE ART
    ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH NFT BECOMES INACCESSIBLE TO BUYER FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY MODIFICATIONS OR CHANGES TO THE
    ART, INCLUDING THE ART BEING DELETED. IF A BUYER PURCHASES AN NFT IN THE ARIA EXCHANGE, AT PRESENT, THE ARIA
    EXCHANGE IS THE ONLY PLATFORM AVAILABLE WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE AND PERMISSIBLE FOR THE BUYER TO RESELL THAT NFT.
    REMOVAL OF NFTS FROM THE ARIA EXCHANGE IS NOT CURRENTLY PERMITTED AND MAY NEVER BE PERMITTED IN THE FUTURE.
  </p>
  <p class="font-bold">11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</p>
  <p>
    VRM WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY BUYER OR SELLER ON THE ARIA EXCHANGE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY A DISTRIBUTED
    DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACK, HACKS, VIRUSES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGICALLY HARMFUL MATERIAL THAT MAY INFECT ANY USER’S
    COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, COMPUTER PROGRAMS, DATA OR OTHER PROPRIETARY MATERIAL DUE TO ANY USER’S USE OF THE ARIA EXCHANGE
    OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE ARIA EXCHANGE, ANY THIRD-PARTY LINKS ACCESSED THROUGH OR IN
    CONJUNCTION WITH THE ARIA EXCHANGE, OR ON ANY OTHER ARIA EXCHANGE LINKED TO IT.
  </p>
  <p>
    USE BY SELLERS AND BUYERS OF THE ARIA EXCHANGE, ITS CONTENT AND ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE ARIA
    EXCHANGE (INCLUDING NFTS) IS AT SUCH USER’S OWN RISK. THE ARIA EXCHANGE, ITS CONTENT AND ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS
    OBTAINED THROUGH THE ARIA EXCHANGE, INCLUDNG PURCHASED NFTS, ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.
    VRM HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE FOREGOING
    DOES NOT AFFECT ANY WARRANTIES WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
  </p>
  <p>
    VRM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO ANY USER FOR ANY LOSS AND TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND WILL NOT BE
    LIABLE TO ANY USER FOR, ANY USE OF NFTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM:
    (A) USER ERROR SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS, INCORRECTLY CONSTRUCTED TRANSACTIONS, OR MISTYPED ADDRESSES; (B) SERVER
    FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (C) CORRUPTED WALLET FILES; (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS; OR (E) ANY UNAUTHORIZED
    THIRD PARTY ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF
    ATTACK AGAINST THE ARIA EXCHANGE OR NFTS.
  </p>
  <p>
    NFTS ARE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THEY EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE HEDERA HASHGRAPH
    LEDGER ON WHICH NFTS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND ANY OTHER BLOCKCHAINS USED IN RELATION TO NFTS AVAILABLE ON THE ARIA
    EXCHANGE (THE “BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY”). ANY TRANSFER OF TITLE THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN ANY UNIQUE NFT OCCURS ON THE
    DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY. VRM DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT VRM OR ANY OF ITS VENDORS CAN
    EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OR RIGHT IN ANY NFTS OR COMPATABILITY WITH ANY WALLETS OR BLOCKCHAINS.
  </p>
  <p>
    VRM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SUSTAINED CASUALTIES DUE TO VULNERABILITY OR ANY KIND OF FAILURE, ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR OF
    SOFTWARE (E.G., WALLET, SMART CONTRACT), BLOCKCHAINS OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OF THE NFTS. VRM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR
    CASUALTIES DUE TO LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE
    BLOCKCHAIN SUPPORTING NFTS INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING FUND LOSSES AS A
    RESULT.
  </p>
  <p class="font-bold">12. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY</p>
  <p>
    IN NO EVENT WILL VRM, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OWNERS,
    OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS, SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNED BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE
    DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY USER’S SALE OR PURCHASE, USE,
    OR INABILITY TO USE, THE ARIA EXCHANGE, ANY OTHER SITES, SERVERS, OR APPS LINKED TO IT, ANY SMART CONTRACTS OR
    DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS EXISTING ON OR CONNECTING TO THE ARIA EXCHANGE, ANY NFTS, ANY LOSS OF FUNDS OR COLLATERAL,

    FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSS OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE ARIA
    EXCHANGE OR ITS CONTENTS OR ANY NFT. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT SHALL
    THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF VRM (INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS,
    EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OWNERS, OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AND SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED
    TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, THE ARIA EXCHANGE, THE SERVICES, NFTS, OR ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PURCHASED ON OR
