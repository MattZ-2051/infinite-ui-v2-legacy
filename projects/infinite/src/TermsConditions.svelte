      <strong>nft license</strong>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Through the use of the Platform, a Seller, consistent with the Terms of Service, will be permitted to mint NFTs
    associated with Content produced by Seller (or its licensors, for which Seller is solely responsible) and license
    them on the Platform. When selling or purchasing an NFT, you agree and understand what characteristics NFTs have and
    how the following terms apply to their sale. An NFT is a digital tool that can represent real-world objects such as
    photographs, videos, writings, or music. NFTs are usually built using similar technology to digital currencies.
    While digital currencies are usually fungible, NFTs usually are not. Each NFT is coded into a blockchain or similar
    technology, contains built-in methods for evidence of authentication and proof of ownership, but the NFT Content,
    which usually resides off chain, could be unauthorized, unavailable, or illegal. When you buy an NFT, the terms of
    your purchase, and the rights you actually purchase and own, may be limited by the license terms or technology of
    the underlying NFT. Some NFTs may include a right to redeem for services or a physical item to which the NFT relates
    and which may carry an NFC Tag. In such instances, once the NFT has been redeemed, the NFT may remain in
    circulation, but the redemption right will be terminated. It is up to you to confirm your understanding of what you
    are selling or buying, and the license you are giving or receiving at the point of sale. If Seller does not provide
    a custom license to Buyer at the point of sale for an item, such as an NFT and its related Content, then the NOCL
    (Attached as Exhibit “A”), shall apply as between Seller and Buyer.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    You further understand that blockchain transactions are usually not reversible. You understand that NFTs and other
    NFTs may only exist by virtue of the ownership record maintained on a blockchain, and are conducted and occur on
    decentralized ledgers. Company has no control over and makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the
    functioning of such blockchain or the persistence or compatibility, or lack thereof, of the NFT or related Content.
    In cases where a transaction involving an NFT is revealed to be fraudulent, illegal or infringing, or a Buyer or
    Seller acts fraudulently or illegally or in an infringing manner, then the defrauded or injured Buyer/Seller shall
    have no recourse against Company, but solely against the respective Seller/Buyer.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    Sellers of NFTs are responsible for providing all necessary information in compliance with all applicable law and
    regulations regarding such NFTs in applicable listings on the Platform.

      <strong>acknowledgment and assumption of risks</strong>
    </h2>
  </div>
  <p class="mb-3">
    Use of the Platform may carry financial and legal risk. NFTs, such as NFTs, are a novel and relatively experimental
    technology. Their value, if any, can fluctuate with great volatility, and transactions conducted with NFTs are
    irreversible. NFTs and smart contracts are typically described using extremely technical language that is difficult
    to understand and requires a deep knowledge of cryptography and computer science. Functionality made available on
    the Platform may have inherent design flaws that have not been detected in testing or may not perform as expected in
    conjunction with third-party technology or high-volume use. You should carefully consider whether you have
    sufficient understanding of the technology and the applicable law before accessing or using the Platform. Hedera
    uses gossip, virtual voting and hashgraph mechanisms to measure consensus. These technologies and platforms may have
    unique benefits, limitations, advantages and disadvantages. It is up to you to understand these factors.
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:lower-latin; padding-left:40px; text-indent:0px" class="mb-3 list-outside">
    <li class="mb-3 text-md">
      By accessing or using the Platform, you hereby represent that you have the requisite knowledge and experience to
      evaluate the risk of the technology you are using and any transactions you undertake, and you accept the risk that
      the Platform might not function as anticipated and that you might lose access to your NFTs and/or the Platform
      temporarily or permanently. Without limitation of the foregoing, you also acknowledge and accept the following
      risks: The prices of collectible blockchain assets such as NFTs are extremely volatile and subjective and
      collectible blockchain assets have no inherent or intrinsic value. Fluctuations in the price of other NFTs could
      materially and adversely affect the value of your NFTs, which may also be subject to significant price volatility.
      Each NFT has no inherent or intrinsic value. We cannot guarantee that any NFTs purchased will retain their
      original value, as the value of collectibles is inherently subjective and factors occurring outside of the
      Platform may materially impact the value and desirability of any particular NFT.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-3 text-md">
      It may be extremely difficult to sell or transfer your NFT, other than via the Platform, due to the nature of the
      NFT and its existence on the Blockchain Technology.

    <li class="mb-3 text-md">
      You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your NFT-related transactions. We are not
      responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the Platform.

    <li class="mb-3 text-md">
      There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, legal risks, the
      risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk
      that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your electronic Wallet. You accept
      and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for legal risks, any communication failures, disruptions, errors,
      distortions or delays you may experience when using the Blockchain Technology, however caused.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-3 text-md">
      The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain, and new
      regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Platform ecosystem, and therefore
      the potential utility or value of your NFTs.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-3 text-md">
      Upgrades to the Blockchain Technology, a hard fork in the Blockchain Technology, or a change in how transactions

  <ul style="list-style-type:decimal; padding-left:30px; text-indent:0px" class="mb-3 list-outside">
    <li class="mb-3">
      The Platform facilitates two different time-based auction formats: Scheduled Auctions and Reserve Auctions. Any
      Seller may use the Platform to initiate a time-based Auction for the sale of one or more NFTs or NFTs such as
      static and interactive media ("Art"). The auction may also follow one of two bidding formats: an English auction,
      in which the highest bid wins at the end; or a Dutch auction, in which the price falls until someone purchases.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-3">
      <strong>Scheduled Auctions:</strong> In a Scheduled Auction, the Seller establishes a specific start and end time for
      an Auction to go live. Sellers may optionally include a Starting Price. As long as the Starting Price is met by an
      Auction Participant, the work will be sold. Works without a Starting Price will be sold to the highest bidder, no matter
      what the bid is. A Scheduled Auction may be cancelled prior to the start of the auction, i.e. when it is counting down
      to kick off. After the auction begins, it cannot be stopped, cancelled, or undone. Sellers that initiate Scheduled
      Auctions should be prepared to sell their works at the Starting Price, or at any price if no Starting Price is established.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-3">
      <strong>Reserve Auctions:</strong> In a Reserve Auction, an Auction for an artwork is configured to automatically go
      live once a bid is received equal or greater to a public Reserve Price established by the Seller. Once the Reserve
      Price is met, the Auction is configured to last for the time set by the Seller. The work goes to the highest bidder
      at the end of the Auction. Once the timed portion of a Reserve Auction has begun (i.e. after the Reserve Price is met),
      the auction cannot be stopped, cancelled, or undone. Sellers that initiate Reserve Auctions should be prepared to sell
      the work at the Reserve Price and should make absolutely sure that they entered the Reserve Price correctly. Once initiated,
      both Scheduled and Reserve Auctions last for a discrete window of time (between 1 hour and up to 7 days for Scheduled
      Auctions and approximately 24 hours for Reserve Auctions). Auction timers are not exact and only represent an approximate
      as to the start or end time remaining for a particular Auction. Participants should get their bids in as early as possible
      to ensure that they are processed by the Auction smart contract before the close of the Auction.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-3">
      <strong>Auction Fees and Royalties:</strong> Company applies the same fee structure to works sold in Auctions as other
      methods. A 5% transaction fee is charged to the Buyer of the work, and on primary sales a 15% commission is charged
      to the Seller.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-3">
      <strong>Irrevocable Bids:</strong> Bids placed during a Scheduled or Reserve Auction are irrevocable. Bids will only
      be returned if a higher bid is placed. Auction Participants should check every bid submitted during an Auction because
      an incorrect bid will be impossible to return.
    </li>

    <li class="mb-3">
