      The Marketplace is an Online Service Provider for facilitating communication between two sets of users: sellers
      (“Sellers”) and buyers (“Buyers”). Sellers may market their sale of items (further clarified below to include,
      amongst other things, NFTs, services, and physical goods) and Buyers may peruse and at their option, bid or buy
      the items. Auctions shall also be governed by the Company Auction Terms (see below), which are incorporated herein
      by this reference. The actual contract for sale is between the Seller and Buyer. Company is not a party to the
      transaction, a Seller, or a traditional auctioneer but does usually receive a fee as an Online Service Provider.
      The Company has no control over and provides no guarantee related to: the existence, accuracy, quality, safety or
      legality of the NFTs and items advertised or user content; the ability or legal standing of Sellers to sell NFTS
      and items; the ability of Buyers to pay for NFTs and items; or that any user will complete a transaction or return
      an NFT or item. Items for sale can include physical goods with our without NFC ships, and services, as well as
      digital items such as non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”), smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, and other digital-based
      goods (collectively, “Digital Assets”). Some Digital Assets may relate or interface with distributed applications
      (“Dapps”) and blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      The Marketplace is offered and available to authorized users who are 18 years of age or older who are acting in
      compliance with applicable law and who are not in breach of this agreement or legal obligations to third parties.
      The Marketplace is unavailable to users who are convicted sex offenders and users who have previously had their
      account disabled by the Company for violations of these Terms of Service or other applicable policies. If the user
      is an organization, you affirm you have the right, power, and authority to enter into this agreement on behalf of,
      and to bind, said organization. If you do not agree to the terms of this agreement, you must not use the
      Marketplace or any of our services. By using this Marketplace, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age
      to form a binding contract with the Company and meet the foregoing eligibility requirements. You represent that

      regulation or directive, relevant to your jurisdiction with regard to the use of our Marketplace. You further
      represent and warrant that you will not use the Marketplace if the laws of your country of residency prohibit you
      from doing so in accordance with these Terms of Service. For the avoidance of doubt, the ability to access our

      laws, regulations or directives relevant to your jurisdiction. All of the Marketplace, or the services made
      available through our Marketplace, may not be available to all users, and we reserve the right to assess or
      reassess at any time your eligibility to use all or part of our Marketplace. The availability of our Marketplace
      does not constitute, and may not be used for the purposes of, an offer or solicitation to anyone in any
      jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is not authorized, or to any person to whom it is unlawful to
      make such an offer or solicitation. By accessing or using the Marketplace, you explicitly agree that the smart

  <h2 class="underline mb-3 text-lg"><strong>License and Access</strong></h2>
  <div class="text-sm font-light" style="text-indent:30px;">
    <p class="mb-3">
      Subject to your compliance with any terms required to access particular functionality or third party offerings (“<strong
        >Service Terms</strong
      >”) and these Terms of Service, and your payment of any applicable fees, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive,
      non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and make personal use of the Marketplace and related
      services. This license does not include any resale or commercial use of the Marketplace data, or its contents; any
      collection and use of any product listings, descriptions, or prices; any derivative use of any service or its
      contents; any downloading, copying, or other use of account information for the benefit of any third party; or any

  </div>
  <h2 class="underline mb-3 text-lg"><strong>NFT License</strong></h2>
  <div class="text-sm font-light" style="text-indent:30px;">
    <p class="mb-3">
      Some Digital Assets sold on the Marketplace may include NFTs. When selling or purchasing an NFT, you agree and
      understand what characteristics NFTs have and how the following terms apply to their sale. An NFT is a digital
      tool that can represent real-world objects such as photographs, videos, writings, or music. NFTs are usually built
      using similar technology to digital currencies. But while digital currencies are usually fungible, NFTs usually
      are not. Each NFT is coded into a blockchain, contains built-in methods for evidence of authentication and proof
      of ownership. When you buy an NFT, the terms of your purchase, and the rights you actually purchase and own, may
      be limited by the terms or technology of the underlying NFT. Some NFTs may include a right to redeem the physical
      item to which the NFT relates and which carries the NFC tag. In such instances, once the NFT has been redeemed,
      the NFT will remain circulation, but the redemption right will be terminated. It is up to you to confirm your
      understanding of what you are selling or buying and the license you are receiving which is determined by the
      Seller in its sole discretion and if no custom license is provided by Seller to Buyer at the point of sale for an
      item, such as an NFT and its related Art, then the NFT Owner Content License (“NOCL”) provided below shall apply
      as between Seller and Buyer. The license to any purchased NFT is a matter between the Seller and Buyer, and
      Company is not a party to the licensing transaction. All licenses and all ownership interests in any Digital
      Asset, such as NFTs, shall pass directly from Seller to Buyer.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      You further understand that blockchain transactions are usually not reversible. You understand that NFTs and other
      Digital Assets may only exist by virtue of the ownership record maintained on a blockchain, and further that smart
      contracts are conducted and occur on decentralized ledgers. Company has no control over and makes no guarantees or
      promises with respect to such smart contracts or the functioning of such blockchain or the persistence, or lack
      thereof, of the NFT or related content. In cases where a transaction involving a Digital Asset is revealed to be
      fraudulent or illegal or an infringement, or a Buyer or Seller acts fraudulently or illegally or in an infringing
      manner, then the defrauded or injured Buyer/Seller shall have no recourse against Company, but solely against the
      respective Seller/Buyer.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      Sellers of Digital Assets are responsible for providing all necessary information in compliance with all
      applicable law and regulations regarding such Digital Assets in applicable listings on the Marketplace.

  <h2 class="underline mb-3 text-lg"><strong>Risks</strong></h2>
  <div class="text-sm font-light" style="text-indent:30px;">
    <p class="mb-3">
      Use of the Marketplace may carry financial and legal risk. Digital Assets, such as NFTs, are a novel and
      relatively experimental technology. Their value, if any, can fluctuate with great volatility, and transactions
      conducted with Digital Assets are irreversible. Digital Assets and smart contracts are typically described using
      extremely technical language that is difficult to understand and requires a deep knowledge of cryptography and
      computer science. Functionality made available on the Marketplace may have inherent design flaws that have not
      been detected in testing or may not perform as expected in conjunction with third-party technology or high-volume
      use. You should carefully consider whether you have sufficient understanding of the technology and the applicable
      law before accessing or using the Marketplace. Hedera uses gossip, virtual voting and hashgraph mechanisms to
      measure consensus. These technologies and platforms may have unique benefits, limitations, advantages and
      disadvantages. It is up to you to understand these factors.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      By accessing or using the Marketplace, you hereby represent that you have the requisite knowledge and experience
      to evaluate the risk of the technology you are using and any transactions you undertake, and you accept the risk
      that the Marketplace might not function as anticipated and that you might lose access to your Digital Assets
      temporarily or permanently.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      You acknowledge the importance of the security measures we put in place with regards to purchases, payment
      methods, and financial accounts, and agree to comply with them. If you become aware of an unauthorized payment
      transaction or of a delayed or incorrectly executed transaction, you must notify us immediately.
    </p>

  <h2 class="underline mb-3 text-lg"><strong>Auctions Overview</strong></h2>
  <div class="text-sm font-light" style="text-indent:30px;">
    <p class="mb-3">
      The Marketplace facilitates two different time-based auction formats Scheduled Auctions and Reserve Auctions. Any
      Seller may use the Marketplace to initiate a time-based Auction for the sale of one or more Items ("Art"). The
      auction may also follow one of two bidding formats: an English auction, in which the highest bid wins at the end;
      or a Dutch auction, in which the price falls until someone purchases. Scheduled Auctions In a Scheduled Auction,
      the Seller establishes a specific start and end time for an Auction to go live. Sellers may optionally include a
      Starting Price. As long as the Starting Price is met by an Auction Participant, the work will be sold. Works
      without a Starting Price will be sold to the highest bidder, no matter what the bid is. A Scheduled Auction may be
      cancelled prior to the start of the auction, i.e. when it is counting down to kick off. After the auction begins,
      it cannot be stopped, cancelled, or undone. Sellers that initiate Scheduled Auctions should be prepared to sell
      their works at the Starting Price, or at any price if no Starting Price is established. Reserve Auctions In a
      Reserve Auction, an Auction for an artwork is configured to automatically go live once a bid is received equal or
      greater to a public Reserve Price established by the Seller. Once the Reserve Price is met, the Auction is
      configured to last for the time set by the Seller. The work goes to the highest bidder at the end of the Auction.
      Once the timed portion of a Reserve Auction has begun (i.e. after the Reserve Price is met), the auction cannot be
      stopped, cancelled, or undone. Sellers that initiate Reserve Auctions should be prepared to sell the work at the
      Reserve Price and should make absolutely sure that they entered the Reserve Price correctly. Once initiated, both
      Scheduled and Reserve Auctions last for a discrete window of time (between 1 hour and up to 7 days for Scheduled
      Auctions and approximately 24 hours for Reserve Auctions). Auction timers are not exact and only represent an
      approximate as to the start or end time remaining for a particular Auction. Participants should get their bids in
      as early as possible to ensure that they are processed by the Auction smart contract before the close of the
      Auction. Auction Fees and Royalties Infinite applies the same fee structure to works sold in Auctions as other
      methods. A 5% transaction fee is charged to the Buyer of the work, and on primary sales a 15% commission is
      charged to the Seller. Irrevocable Bids Bids placed during a Scheduled or Reserve Auction are irrevocable. Bids
      will only be returned if a higher bid is placed. Auction Participants should check every bid submitted during an
      Auction because an incorrect bid will be impossible to return. Violation of these Terms May Result in Revoked
      Restricted Auction Privileges Infinite reserves the unilateral right to terminate a User's account, restrict a
      User's access to the Auctions, or otherwise limit any User's ability to use the Marketplace for violation of these
      Terms. Infinite has absolute and sole discretion to determine whether a User's conduct constitutes a violation of
      these Terms. Disclaimers, Waivers, and Releases User Acknowledges the Risk of Smart Contracts and Blockchain
      Technology Infinite Auctions utilize experimental smart contract and blockchain technology, including non fungible
      tokens, cryptocurrencies, consensus algorithms, and decentralized or peer-to-peer networks and systems. Users
      acknowledge and agree that such technologies are experimental, speculative, and inherently risky. Users
      acknowledge and agree that the Infinite smart contracts may be subject to bugs, malfunctions, timing errors,
      hacking and theft, or changes to the protocol rules of the Ethereum blockchain (i.e., "forks"), which can
      adversely affect the smart contracts and may expose you to a risk of total loss, forfeiture of your digital
      currency or Infinite works, or lost opportunities to buy or sell Infinite works. Infinite assumes no liability or
      responsibility for any such smart contract or related failures, risks, or uncertainties. Users Assume the Risk of
      Participating in Auctions Users hereby acknowledge and assume the risk of initiating or participating in Auctions
      and take full responsibility and liability for the outcome of any Auction they participate in, whether or not
      smart contracts, the Infinite Site, or other Auction participants behave as expected or intended. Users hereby
      represent that they are knowledgeable, experienced and sophisticated in using blockchain technology, the Infinite
