  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Plugins. </strong>
      The Platform may make available the option for you to use “plugins” that are operated by other companies. If you choose

      the Platform (for example, clicking the Facebook “Like” button), you are intentionally transferring information to

      and services, or third parties’ products or services, you can opt-out by checking the relevant box located on the form
      where we collect your contact information or, if presented with the option to opt-in, do not opt-in. If you have an

      enforcement) authorities for our business purposes:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>

  <p>
    As described above, examples of business purposes include performing transactions, registering accounts, managing

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em> Sharing your personal information for commercial or other purposes </em>
      : We have not shared any of your personal information with business partners and other third parties in a manner that
      is likely to be considered to be a “<strong>sale</strong>” under the CCPA.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As described above, this information may be shared for personalization, analytics, marketing, retargeting, and
    sales. We do not sell personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 18 years of age.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your right to know</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, disclosure, and

  <p>We do not provide access rights to B2B information.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your right to obtain a copy of your personal information</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You have a right to obtain a copy of the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called
    a data portability request). Once we verify your request, we will provide you a copy of your personal information
    that is responsive to your request.
  </p>
  <p>We do not provide portability rights to B2B information.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your right to delete your personal information</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and
    retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we verify your request, we will delete (and direct our service
    providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
  </p>
  <p>We do not provide deletion rights to B2B information.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your right to opt-out of sale of your information</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We may share information with third parties in a way that is considered a “sale” under the CCPA. Where that is the
    case, we will comply with California “Do Not Sell” requirements.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How to exercise your CCPA rights</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To exercise your right to know, right to obtain a copy, or right to delete your personal information as described
    above, please submit your request to us by either:
  </p>
  <p>Contacting us at support@goinfinite.io.</p>
  <p>
    To exercise the right to opt-out of sale of your personal information, you can submit a request to us by visiting
    the following link: <a href={infoLink} target="_blank">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal
    information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into personal information sales at any time by
    visiting the following link: <a href={infoLink} target="_blank">Opt-in to Sales of My Personal Information</a>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How we verify requests and respond to requests</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Before fulfilling your request, we take steps to verify you are who you say you are or that you have authority to
    act upon someone else’s behalf. Therefore, upon receipt of your request, we will request additional information that
    we need to verify you and, if you are submitting a request on behalf of someone else, to verify that you are
    permitted to act on that person’s behalf.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we contact you to request verification information, please respond and provide the information that we have
    requested. Depending on the nature of the request you make, we may require you to verify your identity to either a
    reasonable degree of certainty or high degree of certainty. This may mean that we need to match two or three pieces
    of information that we hold about you with information that you provide to us. In some cases, we may require you to
    sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of
    the request or that you are authorized to make the request on behalf of someone else.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to providing the information we need to verify you or your authority, you must provide us with enough
    information so that we can understand, evaluate, and respond to your request. We cannot respond to your request or
    provide you with personal information if we cannot confirm the personal information relates to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify your identity or authority
    to make the request and to locate relevant information. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with
    personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and to understand, evaluate,
    and respond to your request.
  </p>
  <p>
    We cannot delete personal information in those situations where our retention is required for our own internal
    business purposes or otherwise permitted by the CCPA (such as fraud prevention or legal compliance). In these
    situations, we will retain your information in accordance with our records retention program and securely delete it
    at the end of the retention period.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Who may submit requests?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your personal
    information. You may also make request on behalf of your minor child. You may designate an authorized agent to make
    a request on your behalf by registering such person or entity with the California Secretary of State.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How often you can submit requests?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may make a CCPA consumer request twice within a 12-month period.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Response timing and format</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We make every attempt to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we
    require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account
    with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request&apos;s
    receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. When
    you request a copy of your personal information, we will select a format to provide your personal information that
    is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive,
    or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision
    and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-discrimination</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. You have a right not to receive
    discriminatory treatment by us for exercising your privacy rights.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Other California privacy rights</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of the Platform that are California
    residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their
    direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to support@goinfinite.io.
  </p>
  <h2 id="nevada"><a href="#quick-links">Nevada privacy rights</a></h2>
  <p>
    Nevada residents have the right to opt out of the sale of certain “covered information” collected by operators of
    websites or online services. We currently do not sell covered information, as “sale” is defined by such law, and we
    do not have plans to sell this information.
